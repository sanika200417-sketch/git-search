# git-search

Semantic search over your git commit history, right in the terminal.

Type a natural language query and instantly find relevant commits — no need to remember exact messages, file names, or dates. Powered by local embeddings, everything stays on your machine.

## How it works

1. **Indexes** your commit history (messages + changed file paths)
2. **Embeds** each commit locally using [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) via Transformers.js
3. **Stores** vectors in SQLite with [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec)
4. **Searches** using vector similarity — no keywords needed

The index lives in `.git-search/` inside your repo and updates incrementally on each launch.

## Install

```bash
bun install -g forjd-git-search
```

Or run directly:

```bash
bunx forjd-git-search
```

## Usage

Run inside any git repository:

```bash
# Launch the search TUI (indexes on first run)
forjd-git-search

# Force a full re-index
forjd-git-search reindex

# Show index statistics
forjd-git-search status
```

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Type | Search commits |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Switch between search and results |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate results |
| `Enter` | View commit details |
| `Escape` | Close detail / return to search |
| `q` | Quit |

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- **macOS**: Homebrew SQLite (`brew install sqlite`) — Apple's bundled SQLite disables the extension loading that sqlite-vec needs
- **Linux**: Should work out of the box

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev      # Run the TUI
bun test         # Run tests
```
